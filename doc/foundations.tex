\section{Introduction}

Jacinda is an expression-oriented, functional language that performs a subset of Awk's function.

\section{Type System}

A signal defect of the Kempe type system is that it fails to distinguish expressions in the context of a line from expressions in general. In fact expressions in the context of a line form a monad but are not treated as such because explicit typing would be too burdensome and I did not know how to implement implicit coercions.

Consider:

\begin{verbatim}
[y]|> {|`0~/^$/}
\end{verbatim}

This evaluates whether the last line is blank.
