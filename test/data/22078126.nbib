AB  - The 20th-century theory of mammalian sex determination states that the embryo is 
      sexually indifferent until the differentiation of gonads, after which sex 
      differences in phenotype are caused by the differential effects of gonadal 
      hormones. However, this theory is inadequate because some sex differences precede 
      differentiation of the gonads and/or are determined by non-gonadal effects of the 
      sexual inequality in the number and type of sex chromosomes. In this article, I 
      propose a general theory of sex determination, which recognizes multiple parallel 
      primary sex-determining pathways initiated by genes or factors encoded by the sex 
      chromosomes. The separate sex-specific pathways interact to synergize with or 
      antagonize each other, enhancing or reducing sex differences in phenotype.
