TI  - Anorexia nervosa: evidence for a genetic basis.
PG  - 561-71
AB  - This paper reports the preliminary results of a combined twin and family study of 
      anorexia nervosa. Fifty-six per cent of the 25 female monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs 
      and 5% of the 20 female dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs were concordant for anorexia 
      nervosa. Nearly 5% of other female first degree relatives also had a history of 
      anorexia nervosa. Analysis of data from the Eating Disorders Questionnaire (EDI) 
      given to the twins and data as to weight loss, length of amenorrhoea and other 
      characteristics of anorexia nervosa, together with the twin and family data, 
      supports the hypothesis that genetic factors are very significant in the 
      aetiology of anorexia nervosa. Analysis of this data using established techniques 
      of psychiatric genetics suggested that up to 80% of the variance in liability to 
      anorexia nervosa may be accounted for by genetic factors. The problems of this 
      type of analysis are discussed as is the background to the genetics of weight and 
      appetite control. A genetic/environmental model accounting for the features of 
      anorexia nervosa is proposed.
